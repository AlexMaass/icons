Cubing Icons and Fonts
=======

These fonts were generated with [IcoMoon App](https://icomoon.io/app). If you want to just check out IcoMoon, click [here](https://icomoon.io/).

##style.css & cubing-icons.css
Note that we do not have a style.css file in here. This is intentional. That name is far too generic, and comes directly from IcoMoon's download. At the moment, we're not sure how to change the name of the css file, so we ask that you rename style.css to cubing-icons.css before adding it to this repository. 

###selection.json
This file can be uploaded back to the [IcoMoon App](https://icomoon.io/app) to edit the fonts. This is preferred as opposed to creating a new font every time we want to add icons to the font files.

###demo.html
Shows the icon, class name, and content. This is informative, but not that useful otherwise.

###demo2.html
A very simple display of the icons using span tags. This can just be a quick way to play with the css/markup without all the fluff from demo.html

#More to come!
I will write up more info on this when I get a bit more time.
